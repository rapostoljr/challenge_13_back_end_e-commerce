# CHALLENGE 13 E-COMMERCE BACK-END

## DESCRIPTION
Did you ever want to start an E-Commerce Website and needed to keep track of your inventory? With this application, you can easily CREATE, READ, UPDATE, AND DELETE inventory when you need to do so. This is only on the back end of the website, this will not affect anything on the front end.

## HOW TO USE
First, to use this application, you will first need to have Insomnia installed. You can get insomnia by going to the following link https://insomnia.rest/download. Once installed you will need to open your VSCode and clone this repository. Then open the cloned repository and open a new terminal. You will need to install the modules by running the 'npm install' command. Once installed, you will then have to run the seeds by entering 'npm run seed'.
